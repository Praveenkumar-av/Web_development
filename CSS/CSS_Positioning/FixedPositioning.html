<!-- Fixed Positioning 

    Fixed positioning in CSS is a type of positioning that allows an element to be 
positioned relative to the browser window, rather than its containing element. 
An element with fixed positioning will stay in the same place on the screen even 
when the page is scrolled. This is useful for creating elements like sticky headers, 
footers, or sidebars that remain visible at all times.
