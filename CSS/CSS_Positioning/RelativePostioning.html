<!-- Relative Positioning example 

    Relative positioning in CSS allows you to position an element relative to its 
normal position in the document flow. When an element is positioned relatively, 
it can be moved from its original position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. 
However, the space originally occupied by the element is still preserved in the layout, 
meaning other elements will not shift to fill the gap.
