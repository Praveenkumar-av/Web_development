/*
 * This CSS code uses the ID selector to target an element with a specific ID.
 * The ID selector is denoted by the '#' symbol followed by the ID name.
 * It is used to select and apply styles to a single element on the page that has a matching ID attribute.
 * IDs should be unique within a document, meaning that only one element should have a particular ID.
 * This selector has a higher specificity compared to class selectors or element selectors.
 * To use the ID selector, simply replace 'elementID' with the actual ID of the element you want to target.
Eg :
    #elementID {
        CSS styles for the element with the specified ID
    }
*/
